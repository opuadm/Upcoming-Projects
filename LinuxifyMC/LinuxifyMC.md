# LinuxifyMC
## You may wonder what is LinuxifyMC.
LinuxifyMC is a Minecraft 1.21.4 PaperMC plugin (which should be compatible with spigot/bukkit) which is meant to simulate Linux commands, as well as the ext4 filesystem.
Settings for LinuxifyMC are customizable via the /linuxifymc command. Some commands included in this plugin are non-linux commands, and so there's a setting to disable those (as well as removing those commands from the Tab Completion).
This plugin does NOT give SSH access to your server to whoever has specific permissions or has OP; This plugin is just linux terminal but simulated with commands.
I am currently also thinking about making a mod for LinuxifyMC which will contain more things than LinuxifyMC Paper plugin. LinuxifyMC as a Fabric mod might use Sedna or not, but most likely no and will be simulated.
INFO: This plugin does NOT 100% simulate the linux terminal. While this plugin aims to provide a linux like terminal experience, that doesn't mean that it will mimic everything 100%. Keep this in mind.
